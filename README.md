##Designer concept creator MVP server##

Monolithic server application for application for writing game concepts and linear storytelling. This server is written in Spring, supports password authorization and changing privileges when changing projects. He will also need to:

- Store data of system users and their subscriptions and starting privileges;
- Create promotions, which is necessary for alpha testing of subscriptions;
- Data of projects and user participation in them;
- Accept a script from the application and turn it into a Word document using Apache POI.

This is only a demo version, because for the full operation of the application you will need the ability to store project data. It is also possible to switch to microservices, but not within this repository.
Also, the purpose of this project is rather the acquisition of skills and feedback on them, rather than commercial activities.
